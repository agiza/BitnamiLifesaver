Bitnami Lifesaver
================

If you're using AWS and need to get Bitnamu up and running, this documentation will give you everything that __I__ needed to know to get a fairly intricate installation of Bitnami set up. All of the documentation is "out there" on the interwebs but it's not all in one place. It took me 8 hours to clone a server from Linode to AWS. 

This still lacks how to set up virtual hosts on a single IP address. Feel free to fork and fix, or I'll update myself as the need arises.
